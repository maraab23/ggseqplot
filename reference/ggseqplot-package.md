# ggseqplot: Render Sequence Plots using 'ggplot2'

A set of wrapper functions that mainly re-produces most of the sequence
plots rendered with TraMineR::seqplot(). Whereas 'TraMineR' uses base R
to produce the plots this library draws on 'ggplot2'. The plots are
produced on the basis of a sequence object defined with
TraMineR::seqdef(). The package automates the reshaping and plotting of
sequence data. Resulting plots are of class 'ggplot', i.e. components
can be added and tweaked using '+' and regular 'ggplot2' functions.
